Counting divisible number

## **Problem :**

Some people have been studying the following problem: given two numbers, **A** and **B**,

how many numbers from **A** to **B**, inclusive, are divisible by another number **K**.

For example if **A** is 1, **B** is 10, and **K** is 3, then there are 3 numbers

that satisfy this: 3, 6, and 9. Help them by programming a solution to this problem!

**Input:**
The first line is the number of test cases **T**.

Each test case has three numbers **A**, **B**, **K**, each on their own line given

in that order.

**Output:**
For each test case, output one line of the form "Case C: X" (without the quotes),

where C is the case number (starting from 1), and X is the number of integers between **A** and **B**, 

inclusive, that are divisible by **K**.

**Constraints:**

**1 <= T <= 100**

**1 <= A <= B <= 10000**

**1 <= K < 10000**


**Sample Input:**

2

1

10

3

8

20

4

**Sample Output:**

Case 1: 3

Case 2: 4
